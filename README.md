# RHS Mental Health Portal
RHS Mental Health Portal is the product of the joint effort between Redmond High School's Girls Who Code club & Mental Health club. This goal of this project is to increase accessibility of mental health resources in Redmond High School. This app includes information on mental health professionals nearby and common mental health disorders. Students can email counselors through this app via my personal email, birdsrforever@outlook.com. Clicking the "call" button automatically enters student resource numbers into the Keypad. The app is currently in beta stages. Mental Health Club will vet the information & report any bugs. Currently, the app has Android support only. Apple support may be implemented in the future.

## Running the Project
The project is a web app that can be accessed via [Netlify](https://rhs-mental-health-portal.netlify.app/).

## Contributing
Contributing is currently discouraged by people other than the repo's owner. Testing is highly encouraged. All components of this project can be tested by normal use. The call buttons should enter the digits of each hotline to the Keypad but shouldn't automatically make the call. Upon clicking the "Send Email" button, an email to your counselor should be sent from my personal email, birdsrforever@outlook.com. Please notify me what time you sent an email so I can check that it got through. In addition, Mental Health Club is encouraged to notify counselors of changes, review, revise, & update the information on the app. When you encounter an error, please email 1041602@lwsd.org. In your message, include what you were aiming to accomplish, the deviating result, the section of the app the error occured at, & a screenshot.
